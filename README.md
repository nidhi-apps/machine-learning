First  machine Learning-: HEART DISEASE DETECTION
This project leverages machine learning to predict the likelihood of heart disease using various patient health metrics.
The implementation involves-:

1.Data preprocessing- handle the missing values, normalizing data, and preparing it for analysis.
2.Exploratory Data Analysis(EDA)- gaining insights through visualization and  statistical summaries.
3. Model Building-: Training and evalutiong machine learning models like logistic regression, Decission Tree etc.
4. Accuracy and Metrics-Assessing model performance with metrics such as accuracy,percision and recall.

Key Features-
*user-friendly and efficient 
*can be used as a baseline model for healthcare analytics
                                
Second -  LogisticRegression
Dataset Loading: The project imports necessary libraries such as pandas and matplotlib and reads a CSV file (insurance_data.csv) containing data for analysis.
Data Visualization: A scatter plot is created to visualize the relationship between age and the target variable, bought_insurance.
Data Splitting: The train_test_split method is used to divide the data into training and testing sets.
Model Training: Code snippets suggest a focus on implementing Logistic Regression, likely using scikit-learn.
